# Web-DOSA

DOSA stands for Detail to Overview via Selections and Aggregations. It is a multivariate graph visualization system
designed by Stef van den Elzen and Jarke J. van Wijk. You can find the link to the paper 
[here (PDF)](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6875972).

We are trying to implement this visualization system for browsers.
